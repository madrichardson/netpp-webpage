A product based on data from the VIIRS SNPP sensor – The SNPP VIRS data provides a product time series that extends back to 2012;\n2. A product based on the VIIRS NOAA-20 sensor, to ensure the future availability of an interim product until a new generation product is available. \n\nAn important objective of the project was for the interim products to yield results that are similar to those generated by the legacy products, facilitating easy transitions by users to the interim product that require fewer resources for recalibrating their application. A comprehensive statistical evaluation was applied to both interim product lines to document their similarities to the legacy product. On a global level, both product lines yielded results similar to those of the legacy MODIS product. The detailed results and statistical methods can be found on the [Statistical Analysis](stats.qmd) page. Users interested in conducting a statistical analyses tailored to their region of interest will find Python and R notebooks on the [User Resources](user_resources.qmd) page that will guide them through the process. \n\n## The importance of primary productivity\n\nPrimary productivity in marine surface waters is primarily the rate at which phytoplankton convert light energy into chemical energy stored as carbon biomass via the process of photosynthesis. Primary productivity forms the base of the marine food web, supplying higher trophic levels and microbial food webs with an energy and carbon source. It also contributes to the release oxygen and uptake of carbon dioxide in the ocean and atmosphere, and plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Therefore, monitoring primary productivity is important for studying marine ecosystems, managing fisheries, and understanding global biogeochemical cycling. \n\n## Download Interim Product Data\n\nThe two interim products lines are routinely produced and are available online as daily and monthly composites via the <a href=\"https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html\">West Coast Node ERDDAP data server.</a>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a>VIIRS SNPP Interim Primary Productivity</a></li>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/productivity_viirs_snpp_daily.graph\">Daily Composites</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/productivity_viirs_snpp_monthly.graph\">Monthly Composites</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  <li><a>VIIRS NOAA-20 Interim Primary Productivity</a></li>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"https://example.com\">Daily Composites</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://example.com\">Monthly Composites</a></li>\n    </ul>\n</ul>\n\n## Project Team and Funding\n<p>The project team included Dale Robinson, Cara Wilson, Sunny Hospital, Veronica Lance, Johnathon Sherman, Ryan Rykaczewski, Andrea Vander Woude, Menghua Wang, and Melanie Abecassis associated with NOAA CoastWatch; Kim Hyde from NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center; and Ryan Vandermeulen from the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service.</p>\n\n<p>A special thanks to Jesse Espinoza and Madison Richardson who made important contributions to the project including helping to generate the production Python code, produce the primary productivity products and develop the web presence.</p>\n\n<p>The project was supported by funding from the Portfolio Management Branch of NESDIS, NOAA CoastWatch, and CSU COAST.</p>\n\n\n## References\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.1.0001\">Behrenfeld and Falkowski.
