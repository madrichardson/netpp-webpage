    "section": "Trends Analysis",
    "text": "Trends Analysis\nIn order to identify temporal patterns in primary productivity, linear regression trends are calculated at each pixel (latitude and longitude) over a timeseries of monthly data. This approach allows us to visualize spatial patterns of change and evaluate how different satellite sensors track long-term primary productivity patterns. For this analysis, trends between MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP were calculated over a 10-year period (2013-2018; 120 months), while trends between MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-NOAA20 were calculated over a 5-year period (2018-2022; 60 months). The maps shown below provide a visual comparison of these trends between MODIS-Aqua and the VIIRS sensors, highlighting regions of agreement and disagreement.\nWhile the maps are useful for visually identifying patterns, a more quantitative assessment of agreement is provided through contingency matrices and Cohen’s Kappa statistics.\nFor a detailed explanation of the calculations, see the Appendix.\n\n Figure 5. Linear trends in monthly primary productivity from MODIS-Aqua (top) and VIIRS-SNPP (bottom) datasets (2013-2022). Positive values (blue) indicate increasing trends in netPP, while negative values (red) indicate decreasing trends.\n\nThe comparison of MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP in Fig 5. shows strong overall agreement in primary productivity trends, with VIIRS-SNPP displaying fewer extreme changes in magnitude. Most differences in trends occur primarily in the coastal upwelling zones and polar regions, where MODIS-Aqua tends to show slightly more intense positive or negative trends. In the open ocean regions, trends are weaker demonstrating high spatial agreement between both sensors. This suggests that SNPP produces trend estimates that align closely with MODIS estimates, providing users with confidence that VIIRS-SNPP can reliably replace MODIS-Aqua for long-term primary productivity analyses.\n\n Figure 6. Linear trends in monthly primary productivity from MODIS-Aqua (top) and VIIRS-NOAA20 (bottom) datasets (2018-2022). Positive values (blue) indicate increasing trends in netPP, while negative values (red) indicate decreasing trends.\n\nThe comparison of MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-NOAA20 in Fig 6. also shows strong overall agreement in primary productivity trends. However, compared to Fig 5., the MODIS-Aqua - VIIRS-NOAA20 pairing shows more widespread and stronger positive trends (dark blue) specifically in the polar regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Areas of strong negative trends (dark red) for both sensors are concentrated in coastal upwelling zones, particulary off the coasts of Northwest Africa, Peru, and Arabian Sea, though MODIS shows slightly higher intensities. In contrast, trends in open ocean regions are generally weaker and show a high degree of spatial consistency between MODIS and NOAA20. The consistent temporal patterns captured by both sensors support VIIRS-NOAA20 as a reliable continuation of the MODIS record for long-term primary productivity analyses.\n\nContingency Matrices and Cohen’s Kappa\nThe contingency matrix categorizes each pixel by direction of the trend - positive, negative, or not statistically significant - across both datasets.\nThe rows correspond to VIIRS classifications, and the columns to MODIS-Aqua classifications:\n\nn.s. = No significant trend\n\nβ &gt; 0 = Statistically significant positive trend\n\nβ &lt; 0 = Statistically significant negative trend\n\nEach cell in the matrix contains the percentage of pixels that share that classification combination.\nCohen’s Kappa then summarizes the overall agreement, accounting for agreement due to chance and offering a standardized measure of consistency between MODIS and VIIRS trend classifications.\n\n\n\nKappa Value\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n&lt; 0.00\nNo agreement\n\n\n0.00–0.20\nSlight agreement\n\n\n0.21–0.40\nFair agreement\n\n\n0.41–0.60\nModerate agreement\n\n\n0.61–0.80\nSubstantial agreement\n\n\n0.81–1.00\nAlmost perfect agreement\n\n\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the calculations, see the Appendix.\n\n Figure 7. Global contingency table comparing MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP, along with Cohen’s Kappa statistic.\n\nThe key takeaways for Fig. 7 are:\n\n75.9% of pixels show no significant trend in either sensor (top-left cell).\n11.4% of pixels show a positive trend in both MODIS and SNPP (center cell).\n5.0% of pixels show a negative trend in both sensors (bottom-right cell).\n\nThese diagonal cells reflect cases where MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP agree on the direction and significance of the trend. In total, these agreements account for approximately 92.3% of all valid ocean pixels, indicating a very high level of agreement between the two.\nA Cohen’s Kappa value of 0.77 indicates “substantial agreement” between MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP trend classifications.\n\n Figure 8. Global contingency table comparing MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-NOAA20, along with Cohen’s Kappa statistic.\n\nThe key takeaways for Fig. 8 are:\n\n76.5% of pixels show no significant trend in either sensor (top-left cell).\n13.3% of pixels show a positive trend in both MODIS and NOAA20 (center cell).\n4.1% of pixels show a negative trend in both sensors (bottom-right cell).\n\nThese diagonal cells represent agreement between MODIS and NOAA20. Together, they account for approximately 93.9% of all pixels, a very high level of agreement.\nA Cohen’s Kappa value of 0.82 indicates “almost perfect agreement”, meaning that MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-NOAA20 classify the direction and significance of productivity trends similarly far more often than would be expected by chance alone.\nBoth VIIRS sensors show strong agreement with MODIS-Aqua in classifying long-term primary productivity trends with Cohen’s Kappa values that indicate substantial to almost perfect agreement. This confirms that both VIIRS-SNPP and VIIRS-NOAA20 are reliable successors to MODIS for long-term primary productivity analyses."

If you are interested in exploring or replicating these analyses yoursel, check out our Code Gallery for step-by-step tutorials.\n\nUnbiased Relative Difference (ψ)\nThe pixel-by-pixel unbiased relative difference (ψnetPP) was computed for the globe for each month at 9km resolution across two datasets.\nThe unbiased relative difference (ψnetPP) is calculated for each pixel as follows:\n\n\n\\(ψ^{netPP} = \\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} - netPP_{MODIS}}{\\left(\\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} + netPP_{MODIS}}{2}\\right)}\\)\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\nThe difference between VIIRS-based netPP (netPPVIIRS) and MODIS-based netPP (netPPMODIS) values for that pixel is divided by the mean of netPPVIIRS and netPPMODIS.\n\n\nThis metric allows for sensor-to-sensor consistency assessment, ensuring that variations are not biased by absolute magnitude differences.\n\n\nAbsolute Relative Difference (Δrel)\nThe pixel-by-pixel absolute relative difference (Δrel) was created for the globe for each month at 9km resolution across two datasets.\nThe absolute relative difference (ΔnetPP) is calculated for each pixel as follows:\n\n\n\\(\\Delta^{netPP} = \\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} - netPP_{MODIS}}{netPP_{MODIS}}\\)\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\nThe difference between VIIRS-based netPP (netPPVIIRS) and MODIS-based netPP (netPPMODIS) values for that pixel is divided by netPPMODIS.\n\n\nThis metric is useful for identifying systematic overestimations or underestimations in primary productivity estimates between the sensors.\n\n\nLinear Regression Trends\nThe purpose of calculating linear regression trends for each of the datasets is to evaluate how much the products agree or disagree in temporal patterns. Linear trends were calculated in the time series of monthly primary productivity for every pixel with either raw data or anomalies for the MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS-SNPP, and VIIRS-NOAA20 datasets. Finding trends using raw data helps to analyze the absolute agreement in primary productivity estimates between the datasets, whereas calculating with anomalies enables us to focus on trends by removing seasonality. P-values were calculated to test the statistical significance of the trends for each pixel.\nThe trend analysis follows methods outlined in Melin et al. 2017, see the section 2.3 “Trend estimates and comparison of trends”.\n\n\nContingency Matrix and Cohen’s Kappa\nTo quantitatively assess agreement in trend classifications between MODIS-Aqua and the VIIRS sensors, we use a contingency matrix and compute Cohen’s Kappa.\nA contingency matrix compares the direction of linear trends between two datasets—MODIS and VIIRS—at each pixel. Each trend is classified into one of three categories:\n\nPositive trend: statistically significant increasing trend\n\nNegative trend: statistically significant decreasing trend\n\nNo significant trend: slope not significantly different from zero (e.g., p &gt; 0.05)\n\nWe then count how often each combination occurs across all pixels to build a 3×3 matrix:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIIRS Positive\nVIIRS Negative\nVIIRS No Trend\n\n\n\n\nMODIS Positive\na\nb\nc\n\n\nMODIS Negative\nd\ne\nf\n\n\nMODIS No Trend\ng\nh\ni\n\n\n\n\nDiagonal cells (a, e, i) indicate agreement.\nOff-diagonal cells indicate disagreement.\n\n\n\nCohen’s Kappa: Measuring Agreement Beyond Chance\nCohen’s Kappa (κ) quantifies how much the agreement between MODIS and VIIRS exceeds what would be expected by chance. It ranges from:\n\n1 = perfect agreement\n\n0 = no better than random\n\n\n\n\\(\\kappa = \\frac{P_o - P_e}{1 - P_e}\\)\n\n\nWhere:\n\n( P_o ) = observed agreement (proportion of pixels where MODIS and VIIRS agree):\n\n\\[\nP_o = \\frac{a + e + i}{N}\n\\]\n\n( P_e ) = expected agreement by chance:\n\n\\[\nP_e = \\frac{(a + b + c)(a + d + g) + (d + e + f)(b + e + h) + (g + h + i)(c + f + i)}{N^2}\n\\]\n\n( N ) = total number of valid pixels (sum of all cells):\n\n\\[\nN = a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i\n\\]"

    "text": "Unbiased Relative Difference (ψ)\nIn plain language, Unbiased Relative Difference (ψ) is the difference between interim and legacy primary productivity values (netPP), normalized to the mean of the two values. Normalizing to the mean avoids the bias of arbitrarily selecting one product as the reference. For a detailed explanation of the calculation, see the Appendix. This analysis allows us to determine how similar netPP values are between the interim and legacy products.\nFor our analysis, we calculated ψ for each pixel in our global grid for each month over a multi-year timespan. The resulting monthly maps of global ψ allowed us to generate a timeseries of mean global monthly ψ and a map of the multi-year mean ψ for each pixel in our global grid.\n\n Figure 1.\n\nMIGHT NEED A LEGEND\nTemporal Variability. For VIIRS SNPP interim product relative to the legacy product, monthly mean global ψ values are positive over most of the 10-year timeseries, indicating that the interim netPP values are on average greater than the legacy values. The values for the interim product were quite similar to the legacy values, as indicated by ψ values ranging from 0 to 0.07 (0-7% difference from the legacy product) over the entire timeseries. For VIIRS SNPP interim product relative to the legacy product (ADD TEXT HERE)\n\n Figure 2. The timeseries of mean global ψ values for each month from January 2013 to December 2022 (a ten-year period).\n\nSpatial Variability. The 10-year average map reveals the spatial variable in ψ, with most oceanic regions showing &lt;5% difference (lightest blue and pink) between the two netPP products. However, in the tropical and subtropical gyres there is a 5-10% difference between the interim and legacy products (medium blue) and areas of higher differences (&gt;20%) are visible at high latitudes and in coast upwelling regions.\n\n Figure 3. Global maps of the 10-year mean unbiased relative difference (ψ) comparing VIIRS-SNPP with MODIS-Aqua. Positive (blue) values indicate that the interim product netPP values are larger than those of the legacy product and negative (red) values indicate that the interim product netPP values are less than those of the legacy product."

    "text": "Trends Analysis\nTemporal trends were calculated globally for the interim and legacy primary productivity products using linear regression methods. For our analysis, we determined the slopes of netPP verses time for each pixel in our global grid over a multi-year timespan using monthly netPP data. Results for the interim and legacy products were compared to identify how well the two products agree on the presence or absence of long-term trends. The purpose of this analysis was to identify how well the interim and legacy primary productivity timeseries agree using an arbitrarily chosen trend analysis method, not to accurately identify environmentally relevant trends in the ocean. We also applied statistical methods Contingency Matrices and Cohen’s Kappa to evaluate the strength of agreement. For a detailed explanation of the calculations, see the Appendix.\n\n Figure 4.\n\nVisually, the global maps of slopes show very similar trend patterns, indicating that the interim and legacy products yield similar trends (Figure 5).\n\n Figure 5. Linear trends in monthly primary productivity from (a) interim VIIRS SNPP and (b) legacy products (c) for the years 2013-2022. Linear trends in monthly primary productivity from (c) interim VIIRS NOAA-20 and (d) legacy products for the years 2018-2022. Positive values (blue) indicate increasing trends in netPP, while negative values (red) indicate decreasing trends.\n\n\nContingency Matrices and Cohen’s Kappa\nTo obtain more quantitative results from the trends analysis, we built contingency matrices using the slope data. Contingency analysis is an approach used to test whether or not there is an association between categorical variables. We treated the slopes from the trend analysis as categorical variables by recording whether the slope had a statistically significant positive (β &gt; 0), a statistically negative value (β &lt; 0), or if the slope was not significantly different from zero (ns). This categorization was done for each pixel in the global maps of slopes for both the interim and legacy products. Therefore, for each pixel location there were nine possible slope combinations (Figure XX). The cells on the downward-sloping diagonal (from left to right) are the combinations where the interim and legacy products agree.\nFor our analysis comparing the interim product to the legacy product, the percent of the total pixels that fell into each of the nine combinations was tallied and placed in the corresponding cell in the matrix. Tallying the values on the downward-sloping diagonal yielded the percentage of pixels where the slope trends were in agreement. In addition, we use Cohen’s Kappa as a statistical measure to quantify reliability of the agreement between the two products, accounting for the possibility that they could agree by chance. Cohen’s Kappa values range from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). Qualitative categories for Cohen’s Kappa values are listed in Table 1.\n\n Figure 6. Table 1.\n\nTallying the values on the downward-sloping diagonal contingency matrix yield that co-occurrence slope trends shows over 92% agreement between the SNPP interim and legacy products (Figure 7a) and over 94% agreement between the NOAA-20 interim and legacy products (Figure 7b). The Cohen’s Kappa values of 0.77 for the SNPP interim to legacy comparison and 0.82 for the NOAA-20 interim to legacy comparison, translated qualitatively to substantial and almost perfect agreement, respectively.\n\n Figure 7. Contingency table and Cohen’s Kappa statistic comparing (a) the VIIRS SNPP and the legacy products and (b) the VIIRS NOAA-20 and the legacy products."

    "text": "Appendix\nThe following sections provide detailed explanations of how the statistical analyses between the legacy and interim products were calculated. If you are interested in exploring or replicating these analyses yoursel, check out our Code Gallery for step-by-step tutorials.\n\nUnbiased Relative Difference (ψ)\nThe pixel-by-pixel unbiased relative difference (ψnetPP) was computed for the globe for each month at 9km resolution across two datasets.\nThe unbiased relative difference (ψnetPP) is calculated for each pixel as follows:\n\n\n\\(ψ^{netPP} = \\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} - netPP_{MODIS}}{\\left(\\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} + netPP_{MODIS}}{2}\\right)}\\)\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\nThe difference between VIIRS-based netPP (netPPVIIRS) and MODIS-based netPP (netPPMODIS) values for that pixel is divided by the mean of netPPVIIRS and netPPMODIS.\n\n\nThis metric allows for sensor-to-sensor consistency assessment, ensuring that variations are not biased by absolute magnitude differences.\n\n\nAbsolute Relative Difference (Δrel)\nThe pixel-by-pixel absolute relative difference (Δrel) was created for the globe for each month at 9km resolution across two datasets.\nThe absolute relative difference (ΔnetPP) is calculated for each pixel as follows:\n\n\n\\(\\Delta^{netPP} = \\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} - netPP_{MODIS}}{netPP_{MODIS}}\\)\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\nThe difference between VIIRS-based netPP (netPPVIIRS) and MODIS-based netPP (netPPMODIS) values for that pixel is divided by netPPMODIS.\n\n\nThis metric is useful for identifying systematic overestimations or underestimations in primary productivity estimates between the sensors.\n\n\nLinear Regression Trends\nThe purpose of calculating linear regression trends for each of the datasets is to evaluate how much the products agree or disagree in temporal patterns. Linear trends were calculated in the time series of monthly primary productivity for every pixel with either raw data or anomalies for the MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS-SNPP, and VIIRS-NOAA20 datasets. Finding trends using raw data helps to analyze the absolute agreement in primary productivity estimates between the datasets, whereas calculating with anomalies enables us to focus on trends by removing seasonality. P-values were calculated to test the statistical significance of the trends for each pixel.\nThe trend analysis follows methods outlined in Melin et al. 2017, see the section 2.3 “Trend estimates and comparison of trends”.\n\n\nContingency Matrix and Cohen’s Kappa\nTo quantitatively assess agreement in trend classifications between MODIS-Aqua and the VIIRS sensors, we use a contingency matrix and compute Cohen’s Kappa.\nA contingency matrix compares the direction of linear trends between two datasets—MODIS and VIIRS—at each pixel. Each trend is classified into one of three categories:\n\nPositive trend: statistically significant increasing trend\n\nNegative trend: statistically significant decreasing trend\n\nNo significant trend: slope not significantly different from zero (e.g., p &gt; 0.05)\n\nWe then count how often each combination occurs across all pixels to build a 3×3 matrix:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIIRS Positive\nVIIRS Negative\nVIIRS No Trend\n\n\n\n\nMODIS Positive\na\nb\nc\n\n\nMODIS Negative\nd\ne\nf\n\n\nMODIS No Trend\ng\nh\ni\n\n\n\n\nDiagonal cells (a, e, i) indicate agreement.\nOff-diagonal cells indicate disagreement.\n\n\n\nCohen’s Kappa: Measuring Agreement Beyond Chance\nCohen’s Kappa (κ) quantifies how much the agreement between MODIS and VIIRS exceeds what would be expected by chance. It ranges from:\n\n1 = perfect agreement\n\n0 = no better than random\n\n\n\n\\(\\kappa = \\frac{P_o - P_e}{1 - P_e}\\)\n\n\nWhere:\n\n( P_o ) = observed agreement (proportion of pixels where MODIS and VIIRS agree):\n\n\\[\nP_o = \\frac{a + e + i}{N}\n\\]\n\n( P_e ) = expected agreement by chance:\n\n\\[\nP_e = \\frac{(a + b + c)(a + d + g) + (d + e + f)(b + e + h) + (g + h + i)(c + f + i)}{N^2}\n\\]\n\n( N ) = total number of valid pixels (sum of all cells):\n\n\\[\nN = a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i\n\\]"
